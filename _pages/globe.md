A while ago I completed a project that involved the creation of a series of high-resolution world maps. Along the way I found a number of useful sources of data, these notes discuss that strategies I developed to deal with that data:

DEM
https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C1711961296-LPCLOUD&pg[0][v]=f&pg[0][gsk]=-start_date&fi=ASTER&tl=1703889672.142!3!!

LAT Long - remapping
cmap - textures vs displacement.

FILE CONVRESION
AUTOTX of 22k tiles. CMD. Tops

WIND VECTORS
Discuss solutions. 2D speed, 3D with colliders, 2D pops to attrib to volume.
NOMAD
