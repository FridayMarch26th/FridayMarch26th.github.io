In a nutshell? I REALLY like computer graphics. :)

I'm a generalist graphics bod with over fifteen years' experience covering a wide base of different disciplines and working for a large assortment of companies including LG, Intel, AMD, Innocent Drinks, and Samsung. 

I am intrinsically driven, easily motivated, and always looking to level up.

Hit me up and let's work something out (...or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FridayMarch26th) for other things that I've been working on).

You'll like me, I promise.
