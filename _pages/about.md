title: About Me
subtitle: In a nutshell? I REALLY like computer graphics. :)

I'm currently a 3D artist at Territory Studio in London.

I love solving problems with computers, principally with Houdini, and I've been in the industry for around twenty years.

I am possibly living the dream. Possibly. 

I occaisionally post things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FridayMarch26th).

Cheers.
