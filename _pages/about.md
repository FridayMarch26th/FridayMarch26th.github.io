title: About Me
subtitle: In a nutshell? I REALLY like computer graphics. :)
---

I can't stress that enough. I'm a generalist graphics bod with over fifteen year's experience covering a wide base of different disciplines and working for a large assortment of significant companies including LG, Intel, AMD, and Samsung. 

Around four years ago I decided to focus on my principle area of interest - 3D, and a wee while ago I decided to jump from a long stint at a single studio to a freelance career.

A few things I'm into are: Proceduralism in a motion graphics context, proceduralism in any context, forcing After Effects into a coherent linear space, volume displacement in Arnold, digging myself out of a hole with Substance Designer/ 3D Coat, instancing EVERYTHING in Redshift, repairing CAD models with Rhino, pipeline hurdles, picking up tools in a weekend to tackle an emergency on Monday emergency, picking up tools overnight to tackle an emergency that same night, contributing to the @thinkprocedural Houdini discord channel (come say hello!), Charles’ Poyntons work on digital colour, BMD Fusion (so glad it's not dead), Teresa Amabile’s research into motivation, and swimming.

... That'll do for starters; though in all honesty I've a list of things to explore that grows significantly with each passing week.

Having spent the majority of my career in isolation from the wider graphics community. I am intrinsically driven, easily motivated, and always looking to level up.

Hit me up and let's work something out. It'll be AMAZING, I promise.
