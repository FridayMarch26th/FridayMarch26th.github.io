title: About Me
subtitle: Long time CG enthusiast.

I'm currently gainfully employed as a 3D artist at Territory Studio in London.

I love solving problems with computers, principally with Houdini, and I've been in the industry for around twenty years.

My free time either with my family, or making up for not giving adolecent math class my full attention.

I occaisionally post things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FridayMarch26th), in an effort to contribute to the CG community.

Cheers.
