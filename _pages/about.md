title: About Me
subtitle: Long time CG enthusiast.

I'm currently gainfully employed as a 3D artist at Territory Studio in London.

I love solving problems with computers, principally with Houdini, and I've been in the industry for quite a while.

Everyone loves a nice visual, absolutely, but as time passes I'm as happy digging into process as I am looking at an end result.

I'm at heart practically focussed, but I'm not averse to leading a team or helping others to reach their goals. I love talking shop and figuring out a plan of attack.

My free time is spent either with my family, or making up for not giving adolescent math class my full attention.

I occaisionally post things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FridayMarch26th), in an effort to contribute to the CG community.

Cheers.
