title: About Me
subtitle: In a nutshell? I REALLY like computer graphics. :)
---

I can't stress that enough.

I'm a generalist graphics bod with over fifteen year's experience covering a wide base of different disciplines and working for a large assortment of companies including LG, Intel, AMD, Innocent Drinks, and Samsung. 

Around four years ago I decided to focus on my principle area of interest - 3D, and a wee while ago I decided to jump from a long stint at a single studio to a freelance career.

A few things I'm into are: Proceduralism in a motion graphics context, proceduralism in any context, forcing After Effects into a coherent linear space, volume displacement in Arnold, digging myself out of a hole with Substance Designer/ 3D Coat, instancing EVERYTHING in Redshift, repairing CAD models with Rhino, pipeline hurdles, picking up tools in a weekend to tackle an emergency on Monday emergency, picking up tools overnight to tackle an emergency that same night, contributing to the @thinkprocedural Houdini discord channel (come say hello!), Charles’ Poyntons work on digital colour, BMD Fusion (so glad it's not dead), Teresa Amabile’s research into motivating creative teams, and swimming.

... That'll do for starters; though in all honesty my list of things to explore changes with each passing week. Things are added to the top of the list, things fall off the bottom, but there's never any shortage of awesome stuff to engage with.

I am intrinsically driven, easily motivated, and always looking to level up.

Hit me up and let's work something out (...or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FridayMarch26th) for other things that I've been working on).

You'll like me, I promise.
