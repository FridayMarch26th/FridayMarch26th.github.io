title: About Me
subtitle: I REALLY like computer graphics. :)
---

Yo! So I became a freelance motion designer a wee while ago, believing that I could wing it regards a website, rely on Twitter and things shared privately. Multiple sources have explained that this is not the case, and that a bit of a shopfront is better than no shop front at all. I totally agree.

So this is a website, and an attempt at getting SOMETHING online before too long. There's not much here at the minute, but there soon will be.

In the mean time, hit me up on Twitter, or find me in the Think Procedural Houdini Discord channel (If I'm not there right now I'll not be far away).

In a nutshell? I REALLY like computers. I like graphics a lot, too. I also like swimming, but if more often than not while swimming I'm just thinking about computers or graphics.

Get in touch, and I'll cross my fingers that we can get something going.
