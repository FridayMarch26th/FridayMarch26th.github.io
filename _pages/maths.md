A random collection of mathematical resources that I've found useful over recent times. The production values vary wildly, but bite on a stick and keep watching, what connects everything is the clear communication of interesting things.

[IXL Algebra 1 CC.7 Exponential functions over unit intervals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT9slOHJUT0&lc=UgxmcQiob8tQ3AbNfr54AaABAg)

[Radical Expressions and Absolute Value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH3I8wOt1Zc&lc=Ugz075K3Xz7wZSieL2B4AaABAg)

[A visual proof for the difference of squares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIPGEVCOzJ4&lc=Ugw0H_O05RVao47e_f14AaABAg)

[Why does factoring by grouping work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOIxv1ybPro&list=LL&index=67)

These MyWhyU videos are excellent...

[Algebra 1 - Defining Sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYlhVuGBl5E&list=PL20023FA07684B937)

Bridging the cap between algebra and geometry...

[Cartesian Products, Ordered Pairs and Triples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4j4XgVbuxc&list=PL20023FA07684B937&index=9)

A great description of what trig reference angles are...

[Reference angles](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-use-reference-angles-instead-of-finding-the-value-of-trig-function-of-an-original-angle-in-trigonometry-Can-you-explain-it-in-unit-circle)

---

So *that's* what sine and cosine are...

[Eddie Woo talks unit circles](https://youtu.be/gUdksdjuSCk?si=25dAPcXV9DvR14QA)

---

This is neat, even point distributions on a sphere...

[Fibonacci lattices](https://observablehq.com/@meetamit/fibonacci-lattices)

---

My favourite run down of the six trig functions...

(All Trig Functions on the Unit Circle )[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNBZ0bP4SHk]

Eddie Woo does it again, nice run down of why the sine rule works. Interesting geometric constructions used to prove a point...

[]The Sine Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmkT4QiYW6M)

Similarly...
