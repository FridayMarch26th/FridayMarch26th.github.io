The project was the delivery of a straightforward set of product pics for use across a variety of applications.

An opportunity to get into a spot of CAD repair with Rhino 3D. The task became the development of a process whereby a total of six different cards could be translated, in all their fiddly detail, from engineering schematics to motion grahpics assets. So yes, lots of Nurbs modelling (a *really* nice modelling paradigm, given the right tools), bits of python to automate things like material assignment, and as little manual movement between DCCs as I was able to manage.

A simple result (rendered in C4D's physical, so we could hand a finished asset off to whoever), but a really nice project to direct.
