Poly cards for all and sundry.

Six cards taken from engineering schematics to motion graphics assets. Lots of Rhino3D, bits of Python to automate things like material assignment, and as little manual faffing as I was able to manage.

A straightforward result (rendered in C4D's physical, so we could hand off a scene to whoever), but a really nice project to be involved with.
