Some shots used within a larger promo for a generation of AMD chips.

An environment built from particles. Emission from the world origin, spreading out with turns limited to forty five degree angles. Trails created from the particles and used to cut a rectangular grid into pieces. Some of the pieces were extruded to make buildings, others become other things... A bunch more things that for the life of me I'm unable to remember, and that was that.
