Some shots used within a larger promo for a generation of AMD chips, and an environment built from particles.

Particle emission from the world origin, leaders spreading out with turns limited to create technie shapes. Trails created from the particles and used to cut a rectangular grid into pieces. Some of the pieces were extruded to make buildings, others become other things... Plus a bunch more bits and pieces that for the life of me I'm unable to remember, and that was that.
