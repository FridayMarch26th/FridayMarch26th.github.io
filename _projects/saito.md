So many people trying a bit of this at the moment... including me.

Simple shapes, bright colours, bit o' grain, what's not to love?

It's really just a Voronoi fracture, and it's amazing what a bit of symmetry does for a techno aestehic. LOVE the Arnold toon shader though, jolly nice parms to fiddle with and definitely something to return to at a later date.
