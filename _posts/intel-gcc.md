My contribution to a wider project that promoted the switching on of Intel's graphics card optimisation software was number of 'tunnel sections'. Pieces of a journey, each containing various controls suggestive of tweaking, tinkering, and dialling in.

Lots of procedurally modelled technical details and LOTS of instanced geometry. Replecating simple geometry over and over (...and over and over) resulted in a speedy time to first pixel and a very comfortable ride to delivery.
