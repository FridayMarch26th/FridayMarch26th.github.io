Vaguely inspired by some ropes and pulleys that I spotted at the We Are Seventeen website.

The premise was simple enough, figure out a way to automate the creation of ropes and pulleys. The task turned out to be an excercise in calculating common tangents between pairs of circles, and then selecting the appropriate tangent to create tension on the rope, depending on the position of two neighbouring circles.

The resulting doodad I might actually use someday, for now it's just floating around on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FridayMarch26th/status/1177507875322597376).
