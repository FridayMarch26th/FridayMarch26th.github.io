Started as an attempt at some swirly rockets, and a hommage to a [hommage](https://vimeo.com/124908765) to a particle system from one of the transformers movies.

Fire a rocket from ship to ground, use the resulting vector as the axis for the swirls, circular smoke puffs spread out upon impact causing trees to grow... Lots going on, except much of it is so bloody small that it's barely visible. :/

What else... A procedurally modelled a UFO complete with driver, who sports a small shock of Vellum hair. The UFO is online, [here](https://twitter.com/FridayMarch26th/status/1140642195415977984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).

A simple planet, road, car, and a tiny spot of volumetric lighting that for all its simplicity is my favourite feature.

Bit of fun, really.

The animation is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FridayMarch26th/status/1151372566407372802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).
