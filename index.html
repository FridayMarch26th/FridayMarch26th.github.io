		<p>Yo! So I became a freelance motion designer a wee while ago, believing that I could wing it regards a website, relying on Twitter and things shared privately. Multiple sources have explained that this is not the case, and that a bit of a shopfront is better than no shop front at all. I totally agree.</p>

		<p>So this is a website, and an attempt at getting SOMETHING online before too long. There's not much here at the minute, but there soon will be.</p>

		<p>In the mean time, hit me up on Twitter, or find me in the Think Procedural Houdini Discord channel (@FridayMarch26th - If I'm not there right now I'll not be far away).</p>

		<p>In a nutshell? I REALLY like computers. I like graphics a lot, too. I also like swimming, but while swimming I'm just thinking about computers or graphics.</p>

		<p>Get in touch, and I'll cross my fingers that we can get something going.</p>
